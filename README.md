### Final Project: STAN47 - Statistik: Deep learning och metoder för artificiell intelligens

The files within this folder are part of the final project in the course STAN47. The project investigates image classification of brain scans where the following categories exist: Mild Dementia, Moderate Dementia, Non Demented, Very Mild Dementia. A Convolutional Neural Network was created in order to predict which category images belong to, it was later compared to the existing ResNet50 model architecture.

Final_project_data_processing assumes that you have downloaded the images provided from the Kaggle URL and saved them in a relevant directory. Run this notebook to prepare the data before modeling. Once completed, run Final_project_model to model the data and perform evaluation of the model's performance. Then run Final_project_resnet50 in order for comparisons of both models.
